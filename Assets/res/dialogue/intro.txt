Somewhere in a far reaches of the galaxy...
A young space wanderer is strolling about, minding their own business, when suddenly...
BZZZZZZZZT! HELLO!?
Whoa! I didn't expect to actually reach someone!
I'm Dr. Neal, from Planet Earth! I'm conducting a little study and I think I might need your help!
Our trusty Hubble Telescope has been able to take some wonderful pictures of our galaxy.
But, you see, we'd like to take a closer look at these places and maybe get more technical data.
Think you can check these places up-close by yourself and help us with our research?
Great! I have just uploaded a program to your computer that will collect information as you visit them.
Your map should help you on your quest. I've also been able to send you photos from Hubble itself to help you locate them.
Think you can handle this? Sure you can!
Whenever you find a cool piece of information, come here at the Space Hub and send it to us.
Earth thanks you! And remember, have fun as you wander!
